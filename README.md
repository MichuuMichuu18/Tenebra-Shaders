# Tenebra Shaders
A new Minecraft shaderpack focused on mood, simplicity, and restraint.

Designed for **Minecraft 1.17+**. Always tested on the latest version with Iris — backward compatibility (including OptiFine) is not a priority.

This project emphasizes **clarity and intention**, rather than stacking effects “just because”.

## Features
- **Dynamic skies**
- **Natural lighting**
- **2D clouds**
- **Subtle fog & haze**
- **Soft shadows**
- **FXAA (anti-aliasing)** (improved from previous project)
- **Motion blur** (improved from previous project)

## Planned
- Bloom  
  (minimal, toned down compared to my previous project)
- Reflections
- Post-processing  
  (TAA + sharpening, DOF)
- Multiple performance profiles  
  (Low / Medium / High)
- Volumetric light / god rays

## Known issues
 *continuously looking for issues*
